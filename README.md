This repo contains the outsourced `explorer` module of the 
[spatialist](https://github.com/johntruckenbrodt/spatialist) package. For now this is just a code dump and will be 
integrated more deeply in the future.

Here is a short demonstration of the functionality. Each click on the map displays the time series at its location 
and executes several user-defined time series functions.
